* Why can I not subscribe using ticker and fields like other APIs?
	The EMSX service only allows users to subscribe to their own Orders and Routes (placements). Most applications 
	will use only two subscriptions, one for Orders and one for Routes (placements). A list of EMSX fields is required 
	when creating the subscriptions.
